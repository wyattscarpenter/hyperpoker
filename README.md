# hyperpoker

This repo contains various ideas I have had regarding hyperpoker, which I also call generalized poker or generalized hyperpoker. Herein are also contained a 

There are three main categories of thought I have about this. Cards, rules, and a hypothetical video game adaption of the rules and cards. Speaking of that video game, it's worth noting that this repo is *not* public domain and is proprietary to me. However, I would happily strike a deal to someone who actually wanted to take the time to immplement this in a tangible saleable medium.

## Video game implementation (hypothetical)

Anyway, I don't have much to say about the video game, except that you would probably start by playing 0-poker (in which every game is a draw), and then after a certain number of victory points unlock 1-poker, and victories would unlock things in the n-dimensional space of generalized hyperpoker such as hand size, card variety, and special rules like around-the-corner straights. These should be arranged intelligently so that you don't have to beat 2ⁿ things, but you would probably have to beat a lot of things. The poker simulator should also be quite good, on a basic level. Performant, high-definition, modern-style, and 2d (although "fake" 3d can be used for effects or whatever). You should be able to use keyboard, mouse, and controller, individually or in concert. This seems like a lot of work just to do basically well, which is largely why I haven't done it. I'm just too busy looking up playing card wikipedia pages.

Generalized hyperpoker should also be playable in real life, in principle. In fact, the main game I imagine coming out of hyperpoker is basically just texas hold 'em but you can make a 7-card straight.

## Rules

It can be observed that ∞-poker would be unplayable in at least the respect that you would have to draw infinity cards, which would take forever. Maybe you could interpret this in some special way that would still allow you to play a game with it, like you just get to pick any cards out of a static selection of all of the cards (where the stock of each card is unlimited) — but since you also get to play an infinite number of cards, this would be difficult to bound as well. There is also the issue that ∞-number-cards poker has an infinite number of number cards available

## Cards

I thought I had discovered a new tarot-like set of cards in [Lenormand cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenormand_cards), which are labelled things like "Rider" and "House". But these cards have already gone to the trouble of telling you what conventional playing card they correspond to, which I guess just makes them a themed deck of playing cards 🤷‍♂️. TODO: need a name for these. "Pattern", like spanish or french pattern?

Billiard balls, especially pool balls.
