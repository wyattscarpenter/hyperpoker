# hyperpoker

This repo contains various ideas I have had regarding hyperpoker, which I also call generalized poker or generalized hyperpoker. Herein are also contained a wide variety of facts and impressions about playing cards and their history in general, which are relevant only to a small piece of hyperpoker, but must indeed be included for that part (although that part in total can be completely skipped if one does not care).

There are three main categories of thought I have about this topic. Cards, rules, and a hypothetical video game adaption of the rules and cards. Speaking of that video game, it's worth noting that this repo is *not* public domain and is proprietary to me. However, I would happily strike a deal to someone who actually wanted to take the time to immplement this in a tangible saleable medium.

## Video game implementation (hypothetical)

Anyway, I don't have much to say about the video game, except that you would probably start by playing 0-poker (in which every game is a draw), and then after a certain number of victory points unlock 1-poker, and victories would unlock things in the n-dimensional space of generalized hyperpoker such as hand size, card variety, and special rules like around-the-corner straights. These should be arranged intelligently so that you don't have to beat 2ⁿ things, but you would probably have to beat a lot of things. The poker simulator should also be quite good, on a basic level. Performant, high-definition, modern-style, and 2d (although "fake" 3d can be used for effects or whatever). You should be able to use keyboard, mouse, and controller, individually or in concert. This seems like a lot of work just to do basically well, which is largely why I haven't done it. I'm just too busy looking up playing card wikipedia pages.

Generalized hyperpoker should also be playable in real life, in principle. In fact, the main game I imagine coming out of hyperpoker is basically just texas hold 'em but you can make a 7-card straight.

## Rules

Any version of poker that's generalized to less than the current rules of poker is technically more-accurately referred to as hypopoker instead of hyperpoker, but whatever.

It can be observed that ∞-poker would be unplayable in at least the respect that you would have to draw infinity cards, which would take forever. Maybe you could interpret this in some special way that would still allow you to play a game with it, like you just get to pick any cards out of a static selection of all of the cards (where the stock of each card is unlimited) — but since you also get to play an infinite number of cards, this would be difficult to bound as well. There is also the issue that ∞-number-cards poker has an infinite number of number cards available to choose from, but I suppose that's just a user interface issue.

## Cards

### Overview

Due presumably to a latent mental illness, I find myself captivated by what I will call "iconic sets". In a colloquial sense of the term iconic, like how a celebrity is iconic of their medium if they are famous enough, sort of. To insist on this this definition unambiguously, I will use the term "iclonic" for it.

four humors etc

Being public domain really helps your iclonicity, in my view. I don't think it's a necessary condition (nor is it sufficient, for all you playing at home), but it does help — it's related to the idea that there are many tokens of this set being produced, and thus the set is very common.

### Research resources

I mainly relied on Wikipedia pages for my research here. There is a vast hobbyist blogosphere, some blogs of which are even still alive, filled with information on particular decks and card games, but due to my level of abstraction in this endeavor this is usually not very useful to me. I have also considered joining the international association of card games to read their journals.

I am also just aware of things by running into them in my life, and will mention these when appropiate, although likely they are not important.

If I don't link to some source, you can pretty much just assume I'm reading it off wikipedia, and maybe corroborating it with some other sources. I may also give you a link to Wikipedia since this is a sketchy overview and that's step one to getting more information (before step 2, which is, idk, reading an actual book about it, maybe).

### Concepts


Ranks

Suits (and metasuits?)

Patterns (I'm not sure I understand this term nor how specific it is exactly)


#### Styles

Styles are kind of like "fonts", but for playing cards. It would be misleading for me to call them "fonts" because cards typically also have printed text on them, which uses an actual font. TODO: I should figure out the precise taxonomy of playing card elements. Is style sub-pattern or a general term that includes pattern? Should I specify "art style"? "Look and feel"? "Dress"?

##### Modern Linear
I don't know the term (if there is one) for the minimalist-ornate style the modern english pattern commonly gets printed with. Did Bicycle invent it? Sadly their website is pretty uninterested in showing samples. In the interest of clarity I'm going to call this very-popular card style "Modern Linear" (I won't consistently capitalize it, but it is a proper noun, my name for this particular style). I love modern linear. The other styles are ok, but I modern linear is like crack to me. In this document I will repeated muse about creating a full, french-suited, english-patterned, generalized hyper-poker deck, in modern linear style, which I would then place into the public domain.

Modern linear is probably based on the tradition of woodblock printing playing cards, even though those technological limitations no longer apply, but I'm just guessing on that.

Modern linear is the basis of most modern playing cards, and most companies that sell playing cards have their own particular flavor of Modern Linear.

### History

Chinese money cards, probably, although no one is sure as far as I know.

Probably some really ye olde middle eastern cards I don't really know anything about.

Some old european playing cards that never really were in wide circulation

Regular playing cards & variants

The tarot & variants



Animal tarot

Tarot Nouveau

As far as I know there is no Modern Linear rendition of the tarot. Guess I'll have to sink my savings into commissioning a full deck of face-card style tarot cards. Oh well!

Now that Minchiate has pointed it out: I have no idea why the classic tarot includes only 3 of the 4 cardinal virtues (an iclonic set! albeit one I don't really care about), eschewing Prudence but keeping Fortitude, Temperance, Justice.

Hanafuda cards (note that hanafuda cards canonically have 13 *suits* and 4 *ranks*, which is crazy but whatever). Also those crazy poem cards I guess. Also it's weird how the japanese had no playing cards until the portguese imported them or whatever even though they life right next to China.

I think there are asian regional variants of these cards, and maybe their own cards (descended from Chinese money cards), but I don't know much about them.

Jokers

Rules/blank cards?

More suits, colors, and jokers

The joker vs the fool (convergent evolution?)

I guess that's pretty much it.

### Various

I keep looking up Karnöffel because of the hogs in the video game _Inscryption_, and then I realize it's unsuitable for some reason (which reason I usually forget).

I thought I had discovered a new tarot-like set of cards in [Lenormand cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenormand_cards), which are labelled things like "Rider" and "House". But these cards have already gone to the trouble of telling you what conventional playing card they correspond to, which I guess just makes them a themed deck of playing cards 🤷‍♂️. TODO: need a name for these. "Pattern", like spanish or french pattern? Then again, those associations could just be ignored or something (although I suppose they are already quite strong associations).

#### Extra sets

Billiard balls, especially pool balls. Pool is an interesting game because it's also quite amenable to generalization in various ways, and is already a complicated game that has been complixified multiple times — much like card games. The basic form of pool would be something like, just hitting a ball with a stick and trying to get it to go where you want. Even the fact that you have to hit a cue ball instead of the ball directly is a bit advanced. Trying to learn 8-ball pool (which is played with 15 balls, by the way; the 8 is just the most important one) is a hilarious process of trying to just hit the cue ball while you constaintly foul/scratch and aren't even thinking about the color of the balls yet. Anyhow, these also have ranks (numbers) and suits (solids-vs-stripes or color, based on the game I guess). These could be graphically adapted to playing cards.

The Uno cards are actually kind of iclonic, even though as far as I know Uno is still proprietary. Oddly enough, there is a correspondence between Uno special cards and 52's face cards, in the sense that they both exist extra to the number cards, but the most popular generic of Uno is the card game Crazy Eights, which just uses some number cards to be the special cards instead. I guess there are many of these "shedding" games, and maybe one corresponds closer. Anyway, I'm not sure what intellectual property protections apply to Uno. Obviously they have the trademark and presumably trade dress, but it's impossible to copyright the connect of "reverse" and the Uno Reverse icon is pretty simple, so presumably you could make French-suited uno-type cards and add them to a deck of playing cards without comment ("without comment", by which I mean "not misleading the consumer to think you are actually Uno, the proprietary product). This would probably be legal in the USA (this is not legal advice and I am not your attorney) but might be illegal in different regimes. I'm not sure if we can call the collection-of-game-mechanics presented by the branded-product Uno "uno" or if the law will force us to use some weird name like "nou" (or perhaps one of the shedding games already discussed), but games in the uno family are certainly known as unoids ("oo-noids" /ˈuː.nojdz/) or perhaps nouoids. (The company that makes Uno makes many Uno-branded unoids itself.) In the USA you can't copyright game mechanics and it's unlikely that they've patented them. Again, other countries may be different Anyway, the cards in question (with my unicode approximations of the symbols) are "Skip"(🛇), "Draw Two"(+2 ⧉), and "Reverse"(🔃︎). The deck also contains four "Wild" cards and four "Wild Draw Four", which should be depicted with the appropriate suits in a 2×2 grid. In Uno the suits are red, blue, yellow, green. Uno is played with a deck that is basically two standard decks, aces low (=1), no faces, no jokers, no tens. Plus four 0s (one of each suit); 8 skip, reverse, & +2 (two of each suit); 4 wilds; and 4 wild draw four. Maybe some day I will commission some french-suited modern linear unoid cards.

Dice are iclonic, and they could be graphically adapted to playing cards (I'll call this gradaptable, for short) — both the normal pips of dice and the platonic solid dice — but I'm not really interested in that. (there are plenty of iclonic sets that could be graphically adapted to playing cards but are not particularly interesting to, like the four humors, the latin letters, etc).

The stock characters of the commedia dell'arte (hence: cda) are fairly iclonic, and could be adapted to playing cards. Some have been in the past! I would need to know a lot more about the characters in the commedia dell'arte. In particular, I would like to know if they form a closed set (by which I mean a finite known collection), since every time I see the cda mentioned it seems to be in conjunction with a new "stock character" thereof that I have never heard of before.

The american presidents would be a fun idea to create a tarot-like playing card game for. That's before you even get into trump/Trump jokes lol. I think the States (& perhaps also the territories) of the United States Of America are techincally an iclonic set, but I don't find them very interesting; perhaps they could be used as a play element in the Presidents card game.

Oh... honorary mention here to Justine Lai's painting series "Join Or Die", which depicts her and every president (is it every president? I've never been able to find the complete collection to substantiate that claim) in, um, congress. It's not really relevant to this card game idea but hey it's an iclonic set, good job Justine. Maybe she could be a card in the game. (I'm not sure if she actually wants attention for this or not, since she seems to have taken most of her web prescence, but that's possibly just incidental.) Uhhh history shows that odds are I'm never going to make this game I'm scheming about, btw. But I do scheme!

The pieces of chess are iclonic, and could be graphically adapted to playing cards. There is some overlap here, for instance in "king" and "queen". Also, I think this gets you to chinese chess, which actually also comes from the chinese money cards above? There's a convulted history here, I think. The iclonic set of chess pieces also includes fairy chess pieces.

Mah jong: seems iclonic, and gradptable. I don't know anything about mah jong, though. And I'm not super interested in it, although I wouldn't rule it out.
